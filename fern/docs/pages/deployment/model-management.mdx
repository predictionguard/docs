# Model Management

Learn how to deploy, configure, and manage models in your self-hosted Prediction Guard instance.

## Model Deployment

### From Hugging Face

1. **Browse the model library** in the admin panel
2. **Search for models** by name, type, or capability
3. **Review model details** including size, requirements, and performance
4. **Click Deploy** and configure deployment settings
5. **Monitor deployment progress** and resolve any issues

### Custom Models

1. **Upload model files** to your instance
2. **Configure model metadata** (name, description, capabilities)
3. **Set resource requirements** (CPU, GPU, memory)
4. **Deploy and test** the model
5. **Make available** to API users

## Model Configuration

### Basic Settings
- **Model name** and description
- **Temperature** and sampling parameters
- **Maximum tokens** and context length
- **Stop sequences** and special tokens

### Advanced Settings
- **Resource allocation** (CPU cores, GPU memory)
- **Scaling policies** (auto-scale based on demand)
- **Caching configuration** for performance
- **Security policies** and access controls

## Model Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- **Inference latency** and throughput
- **Resource utilization** (CPU, GPU, memory)
- **Error rates** and failure analysis
- **Usage statistics** and trends

### Health Monitoring
- **Model availability** and uptime
- **Response quality** and accuracy
- **Resource exhaustion** alerts
- **Performance degradation** detection

## Model Lifecycle

### Versioning
- **Model versioning** for updates and rollbacks
- **A/B testing** between model versions
- **Gradual rollout** of new versions
- **Version comparison** and analysis

### Updates and Maintenance
- **Automatic updates** for security patches
- **Manual updates** for new model versions
- **Rollback procedures** for failed updates
- **Maintenance windows** and scheduling

## Best Practices

### Deployment
- **Test models** in staging before production
- **Start with smaller models** for initial deployment
- **Monitor resource usage** during deployment
- **Document model configurations** for team members

### Management
- **Regular health checks** and monitoring
- **Backup model configurations** and settings
- **Plan for model updates** and maintenance
- **Monitor costs** and resource usage

### Security
- **Validate model sources** before deployment
- **Scan models** for security vulnerabilities
- **Control access** to model management features
- **Audit model changes** and deployments
