### Supported Model Types

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Text generation, chat, completion
- **Large Vision Models (LVMs)**: Image analysis, visual understanding
- **Embedding Models**: Text embeddings, similarity search
- **Fine-tuned Models**: Custom models for specific industries or use cases

### Hardware Support

- **NVIDIA GPUs**: A100, V100, RTX series, and more
- **Intel Gaudi**: High-performance AI accelerators
- **CPU-only**: For smaller models or development
- **Multi-GPU**: Distributed inference across multiple GPUs

### From Hugging Face

1. **Browse the model library** in the admin panel
2. **Search for models** by name, type, or capability
3. **Review model details** including size, requirements, and performance
4. **Click Deploy** and configure deployment settings
5. **Monitor deployment progress** and resolve any issues

### Custom Models

1. **Upload model files** to your instance
2. **Configure model metadata** (name, description, capabilities)
3. **Set resource requirements** (CPU, GPU, memory)
4. **Deploy and test** the model
5. **Make available** to API users

## Model Security Scanning

Prediction Guard automatically scans all models to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities:

### Security Risk Assessment

- **PII Leak Susceptibility**: How likely the model is to leak personally identifiable information
- **Prompt Injection Vulnerability**: Susceptibility to prompt injection attacks
- **Toxicity Risk**: Potential for generating harmful or toxic content
- **Bias Assessment**: Evaluation of potential bias in model outputs
- **Data Privacy**: Assessment of data handling and privacy risks

### Scanning Scores

Each model receives security scores across multiple dimensions:
- **Overall Security Score**: Composite score based on all risk factors
- **Risk Level**: Low, Medium, High, or Critical
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions to improve model security
- **Compliance**: Alignment with security standards and regulations

### Risk Mitigation

- **Input Filtering**: Automatic filtering of potentially harmful inputs
- **Output Sanitization**: Cleaning and validation of model outputs
- **Access Controls**: Restricting model access based on risk levels
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of model behavior and outputs

## Model Configuration

### Basic Settings
- **Model name** and description
- **Temperature** and sampling parameters
- **Maximum tokens** and context length
- **Stop sequences** and special tokens

### Advanced Settings
- **Resource allocation** (CPU cores, GPU memory)
- **Scaling policies** (auto-scale based on demand)
- **Caching configuration** for performance
- **Security policies** and access controls

## Model Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- **Inference latency** and throughput
- **Resource utilization** (CPU, GPU, memory)
- **Error rates** and failure analysis
- **Usage statistics** and trends

### Health Monitoring
- **Model availability** and uptime
- **Response quality** and accuracy
- **Resource exhaustion** alerts
- **Performance degradation** detection

## Model Lifecycle

### Versioning
- **Model versioning** for updates and rollbacks
- **A/B testing** between model versions
- **Gradual rollout** of new versions
- **Version comparison** and analysis

### Updates and Maintenance
- **Automatic updates** for security patches
- **Manual updates** for new model versions
- **Rollback procedures** for failed updates
- **Maintenance windows** and scheduling

## Best Practices

### Deployment
- **Test models** in staging before production
- **Start with smaller models** for initial deployment
- **Monitor resource usage** during deployment
- **Document model configurations** for team members

### Management
- **Regular health checks** and monitoring
- **Backup model configurations** and settings
- **Plan for model updates** and maintenance
- **Monitor costs** and resource usage

### Security
- **Validate model sources** before deployment
- **Scan models** for security vulnerabilities
- **Control access** to model management features
- **Audit model changes** and deployments
