# Architecture Overview

This page provides an overview of the Prediction Guard self-hosted architecture and its components.

## System Architecture

Prediction Guard's self-hosted architecture is designed for flexibility, scalability, and security.

### Core Components

#### Admin Panel
- **Web-based interface** for managing your deployment
- **Model configuration** and deployment
- **API key management** and access control
- **Monitoring dashboard** with usage analytics

#### Model Management System
- **Dynamic model deployment** - deploy any model from Hugging Face
- **Model versioning** and updates
- **Resource allocation** and scaling
- **Model health monitoring**

#### API Gateway
- **RESTful API** for all Prediction Guard services
- **Authentication** and authorization
- **Rate limiting** and usage tracking
- **Load balancing** across model instances

#### Security Layer
- **Input filtering** and validation
- **Output safeguarding** and content filtering
- **PII detection** and redaction
- **Injection prevention**

### Deployment Patterns

#### Single Instance
- **Simple deployment** for development or small teams
- **Docker container** with all services
- **Local model storage** and management

#### Distributed Deployment
- **Microservices architecture** for production
- **Separate containers** for each component
- **Shared storage** and database
- **Load balancing** and auto-scaling

#### Air-Gapped Deployment
- **Offline installation** packages
- **Self-contained** model repositories
- **No external dependencies** required
- **Secure update mechanisms**

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **Internal communication** over secure channels
- **API authentication** with JWT tokens
- **Network segmentation** for sensitive components
- **Firewall configuration** guidelines

### Data Security
- **Encryption at rest** for model storage
- **Encryption in transit** for API communication
- **Secure key management** for API keys
- **Audit logging** for all operations

### Model Security
- **Model validation** and integrity checks
- **Sandboxed execution** environments
- **Resource limits** and isolation
- **Model access controls**

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Multiple API instances** behind load balancer
- **Model instance scaling** based on demand
- **Database clustering** for high availability
- **Distributed storage** for large models

### Vertical Scaling
- **Resource allocation** per model
- **GPU memory management** for large models
- **CPU optimization** for inference workloads
- **Storage optimization** for model caching

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- **API usage statistics** and performance
- **Model inference metrics** and latency
- **Resource utilization** monitoring
- **Error rates** and failure tracking

### Logging
- **Structured logging** across all components
- **Audit trails** for security events
- **Debug logging** for troubleshooting
- **Centralized log aggregation**

### Alerting
- **Performance threshold** alerts
- **Error rate** monitoring
- **Resource exhaustion** warnings
- **Security event** notifications
