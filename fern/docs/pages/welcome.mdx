## About Us
<br>

</br>
Prediction Guard allows you to integrate secure, private GenAI functionality into your software applications via an easy-to-use API. The API can be self-hosted or accessed via our managed cloud offering. These docs are relevant to both the self-hosted and managed cloud offerings (although a self-hosted installation might have a variety of custom models deployed that are not listed throughout these docs).

<Tip>
  Prediction Guard does NOT save or share any data sent to our models (or
  responses from the models). Further, we are able to sign a BAA for customers
  needing HIPAA compliance. [Contact support](support) with any questions
