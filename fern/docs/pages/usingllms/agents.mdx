Prompts, chaining, and prompt engineering is important. However, you might not
always know what chain or prompts you need to execute prior to receiving user
input or new data. This is where automation and **agents** can help. This is an
active area of development, but some very useful tooling is available.

In the following we will explore using
[LangChain agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/personal_assistants.html)
with Prediction Guard LLMs to detect and automate LLM actions.

We will use LangChain again, but we will also use a Google search API called
SerpAPI. You can get a free API key for SerpAPI [here](https://serpapi.com/).

We will use Python to show an example:

## Dependencies and Imports

You will need to install the Prediction Guard, LangChain and Google Search Results
dependencies in you Python environment.

```bash
$ pip install predictionguard langchain google-search-results
```

Now import PredictionGuard and the other dependencies, setup your API Key, and
create the client.

```python
import os
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import PredictionGuard
from predictionguard import PredictionGuard

# Set your Prediction Guard token as an environmental variable.
os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY"] = "<api key>"

client = PredictionGuard()

os.environ['SERPAPI_API_KEY'] = "<your serpapi api key>"
```

## Agents

To setup an agent that will search the internet on-the-fly and use the LLM to
generate a response:

```python copy
# In LangChain, "tools" are like resources that are available to your agent to
# execute certain actions (like a Google Search) while trying to complete a
# set of tasks. An "agent" is the object that you "run" to try and get a "Final Answer."
tools = load_tools(["serpapi"], llm=PredictionGuard(model="Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B"))
agent = initialize_agent(tools, PredictionGuard(model="Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B"),
                         agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

agent.run("How are Domino's gift cards delivered?")
```

This will verbosely log the agents activities until it reaching a final answer
nd generates the response:

```

Thought:We have gathered various information about Domino's gift card delivery process
Final Answer: Domino's gift cards can be delivered electronically or physically, and can be used for online, phone, or in-store orders. They can be sent as eGift cards or physical cards, and can be used for both delivery and carryout orders.

> Finished chain.
Domino's gift cards can be delivered electronically or physically, and can be used for online, phone, or in-store orders. They can be sent as eGift cards or physical cards, and can be used for both delivery and carryout orders.
