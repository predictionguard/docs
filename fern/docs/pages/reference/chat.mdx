You can get chat text completions (based on a thread of chat messages) from any of the chat enabled [models](../models) using the `/chat/completions` REST API endpoint or `Chat` Python client class.

## Generate a chat text completion

To generate a chat text completion, you can use the following code examples. Depending on your preference or requirements, select the appropriate method for your application.

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python filename="main.py"
    import os
    import json

    from predictionguard import PredictionGuard

    # Set your Prediction Guard token as an environmental variable.
    os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_API_KEY"] = "<your access token>"
    
    client = PredictionGuard()

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant that provide clever and sometimes funny responses."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's up!"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Well, technically vertically out from the center of the earth."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Haha. Good one."
        }
    ]

    result = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="Neural-Chat-7B",
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=500
    )

    print(json.dumps(
        result,
        sort_keys=True,
        indent=4,
        separators=(',', ': ')
    ))
    ```
