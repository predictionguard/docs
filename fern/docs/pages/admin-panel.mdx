## Admin Panel Getting Started

The Prediction Guard admin panel is your central hub for managing your Prediction Guard instance.

## Accessing the Admin Panel

Once your Prediction Guard instance is installed, you can access the admin panel at:

```
https://your-domain.com/admin
```

### Initial Setup

1. **Login** with your admin credentials
2. **Select your cluster** from the dropdown menu
3. **Navigate to the Dashboard** to see system overview
4. **Create your first cluster** if needed
5. **Install your first model** and generate API keys

## Admin Panel Interface

### Cluster Selection
- **Dropdown menu** to select which cluster you're managing
- **Switch between clusters** for multi-cluster deployments
- **Cluster-specific** settings and configurations

### Dashboard Tab
- **Total number of clusters** in your installation
- **Number of models** installed across all clusters
- **Number of active models** currently running
- **System activity** and recent events
- **Quick overview** of cluster health and status
- **Security alerts and monitoring** with real-time risk detection
- **Guardrails status** showing PII, prompt injection, factuality, and toxicity checks

### Clusters Tab
- **Manage existing clusters** and their configurations
- **Create new clusters** by providing:
  - Cluster name and description
  - Resource specifications
  - Network configuration
  - Security settings
- **Monitor cluster health** and performance
- **Scale clusters** up or down as needed

### Models Tab
- **Manage models** installed in the selected cluster
- **Configure and install models** with:
  - Model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
  - Hardware requirements (CPU, GPU, memory)
  - Scaling policies and resource allocation
  - Model versioning and updates
- **Monitor model performance** and usage statistics

### Audit Logs Tab
- **View system activity logs** for security and compliance
- **Track user actions** and administrative changes
- **Monitor API usage** and access patterns
- **Export logs** for analysis and reporting

### API Keys Tab
- **Manage API keys** for your production cluster
- **Create and configure** new API keys
- **Set permissions** and access controls
- **Track usage** and monitor key activity

## Security Monitoring & Alerts

### Real-Time Risk Detection
The admin panel includes a comprehensive security monitoring system that provides:

- **PII Detection Alerts** - Real-time notifications when personally identifiable information is detected
- **Prompt Injection Monitoring** - Immediate alerts for potential injection attacks
- **Factuality Checks** - Monitoring for inaccurate or misleading outputs
- **Toxicity Detection** - Alerts for harmful or inappropriate content
- **Security Dashboard** - Centralized view of all security events and risk levels

### Dashboard Integration
Connect your Prediction Guard security logs to your existing dashboarding systems:

- **Export security logs** in standard formats (JSON, CSV)
- **API endpoints** for real-time log streaming
- **Webhook integration** for instant alerts to your monitoring systems
- **Compatible with** popular tools like Grafana, Datadog, Splunk, and custom dashboards
- **Custom metrics** and KPIs for security monitoring

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
- **Implement role-based access control** for users
- **Regularly review audit logs** for suspicious activity
- **Keep your Prediction Guard instance updated** to the latest versions
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit

### Performance
- **Optimize resource allocation** for models
- **Monitor system health** and resource utilization
- **Implement caching strategies** for frequently accessed data

### Scalability
- **Design for horizontal scaling** of clusters
- **Use load balancing** for high availability
- **Plan for future growth** and capacity needs
