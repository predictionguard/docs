## Model Descriptions

### llava-1.5-7b-hf

LLaVa is a multimodal model that supports vision and language models combined.

_**This Model is required to be used with the `/chat/completions` vision endpoint.
Most of the SDKs will not ask you to provide model because it's using this one.**_

**Type:** Vision Text Generation\
**Use Case:** Used for Generating Text from Text and Image Inputs
