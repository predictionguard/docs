This page provides information on the Large Language Models (LLMs) that are available in the Prediction Guard API.
These models are designed for text inference, and are used in the `/completions` and `/chat/completions` endpoints.

## Model Descriptions

### Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B

This is a general use model that excels at reasoning and multi-turn conversations,
with an improved focus on longer context lengths. This allows for more accuracy and recall
in areas that require a longer context window, along with being an improved version of the previous
Hermes and Llama line of models.

**Type:** Chat\
**Use Case:** Instruction Following or Chat-Like Applications\
**Prompt Format:** [ChatML](/options/prompts#chatml)

https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B

Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2,
including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning,
multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

The ethos of the Hermes series of models is focused on aligning LLMs to the user,
with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

The Hermes 3 series builds and expands on the Hermes 2 set of capabilities,
including more powerful and reliable function calling and structured output capabilities,
generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills.

### neural-chat-7b-v3-3

A revolutionary AI model for performing digital conversations.

**Type:** Chat\
**Use Case:** Instruction Following or Chat-Like Applications\
**Prompt Format:** [Neural Chat](/options/prompts#neural-chat)

https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3

This model is a fine-tuned 7B parameter LLM on the Intel Gaudi 2 processor from
the Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1 on the meta-math/MetaMathQA dataset. The model was
aligned using the Direct Performance Optimization (DPO) method with
Intel/orca_dpo_pairs. The Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1 was originally fine-tuned
from mistralai/Mistral-7B-v-0.1. For more information, refer to the blog
