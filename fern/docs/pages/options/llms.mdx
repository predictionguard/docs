## Model Descriptions

### Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B

This is a general use model that excels at reasoning and multi-turn conversations,
with an improved focus on longer context lengths. This allows for more accuracy and recall
in areas that require a longer context window, along with being an improved version of the previous
Hermes and Llama line of models.

**Type:** Chat\
**Use Case:** Instruction Following or Chat-Like Applications\
**Prompt Format:** [ChatML](/options/prompts#chatml)

https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B

Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2,
including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning,
multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

The ethos of the Hermes series of models is focused on aligning LLMs to the user,
with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

The Hermes 3 series builds and expands on the Hermes 2 set of capabilities,
including more powerful and reliable function calling and structured output capabilities,
generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills.

### gpt-oss-120b

gpt-oss-120b is OpenAI's open-weight model designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases. This model features configurable reasoning effort and full chain-of-thought capabilities.

**Type:** Chat/Reasoning  
**Use Case:** Instruction following or chat-like applications with reasoning  
**Prompt Format:** [ChatML](/options/prompts#chatml)  

https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b

gpt-oss-120b is part of OpenAI's gpt-oss series of open-weight models designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases. The model features:

- **Configurable reasoning effort:** Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.
- **Full chain-of-thought:** Gain complete access to the model's reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs.
- **Agentic capabilities:** Use the model's native capabilities for function calling, web browsing, Python code execution, and Structured Outputs.
- **Apache 2.0 license:** Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent riskâ€”ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.
- **MXFP4 quantization:** The model was post-trained with MXFP4 quantization of the MoE weights, making it run efficiently on a single 80GB GPU (like NVIDIA H100 or AMD MI300X).  

### Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct

Qwen2.5-Coder is the latest series of code-specific Qwen large language models (formerly known as CodeQwen). 
It is designed to enhance code generation, reasoning, and fixing, making it a powerful tool for developers.  

**Type:** Code Generation
**Use Case:** Generating computer code or answering tech questions 
**Prompt Format:** [ChatML](/options/prompts#chatml)   

https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct

Qwen2.5-Coder builds on the strong foundation of **Qwen2.5**, scaling up training tokens  
to **5.5 trillion**, incorporating diverse data sources such as source code, text-code grounding  
and synthetic data.  

### **Key Improvements Over CodeQwen1.5**
- **Enhanced Code Abilities:** Significant improvements in **code generation, reasoning, and fixing**.  
- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves coding performance on par with **GPT-4o**.  
- **Real-World Application Support:** Designed to power **Code Agents**, with strengths in coding,  
  mathematics, and general reasoning.  

Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct balances model size and performance, offering strong coding capabilities  
with instruction tuning for better usability.

### neural-chat-7b-v3-3

A revolutionary AI model for performing digital conversations.

**Type:** Chat\
**Use Case:** Instruction Following or Chat-Like Applications\
**Prompt Format:** [Neural Chat](/options/prompts#neural-chat)

https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3

This model is a fine-tuned 7B parameter LLM on the Intel Gaudi 2 processor from
the Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1 on the meta-math/MetaMathQA dataset. The model was
aligned using the Direct Performance Optimization (DPO) method with
Intel/orca_dpo_pairs. The Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1 was originally fine-tuned
from mistralai/Mistral-7B-v-0.1. For more information, refer to the blog
