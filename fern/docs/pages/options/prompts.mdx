You might be used to entering simple text prompts into systems like ChatGPT.
However, when you utilize certain open access LLMs directly, you might want to
follow a specific prompt format. These models are fine-tuned using prompt data,
and if you match your prompt formats to that training data format then you can
see boosts in performance.

Check out the [model details page](models) to learn which prompt formats match
certain LLMs. We've included some of the most important prompt formats below.

<Info>
  **Note on Chat model prompts** - For your convenience, we automatically apply
  the right prompt formats when you supply a `messages` object to our
  `/chat/completions` endpoint or via the `client.chat.completions.create()`
  method in the Python client. You don't have to add in special tokens or apply
  the below prompt formats as this will duplicate the formatting. However, if
  you want to use chat-tuned models in the `/completions` endpoint or via the
  `client.completions.create()` method, you should apply the appropriate one of
  the below prompt formats.

## Alpaca

This format has two options. First, for prompts that are single instructions,
without relevant context (e.g., retrieved context):

```
### Instruction:
<prompt>

### Response:
<leave a newline blank for model to respond>
```

For prompts where context is injected:

```
### Instruction:
<prompt>

### Input:
<additional context>

### Response:
<leave a newline blank for model to respond>
```

(Replace the portions of the prompt below in `<...>` with the appropriate
information, and do not keep the `<` or `>` characters)

## Neural Chat

(Replace the portions of the prompt below in `<...>` with the appropriate
information, and do not keep the `<` or `>` characters)

```
### System:
<prompt>
### User:
<context or user message>
### Assistant:
```

## ChatML

(Replace the portions of the prompt below in curly braces `{...}` with the
appropriate information, and do not keep the curly braces)

```
<|im_start|>system
{prompt}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
{context or user message}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant<|im_end|>
```

## gpt-oss

gpt-oss models use the ChatML format for optimal performance. The model is trained on the harmony response format and should be used with ChatML formatting.

(Replace the portions of the prompt below in curly braces `{...}` with the
appropriate information, and do not keep the curly braces)

```
<|im_start|>system
{prompt}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
{context or user message}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant<|im_end|>
```
