### Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B

A general use model that maintains excellent general task and conversation
capabilities while excelling at JSON Structured Outputs and improving on several
other metrics.

**Type**: Chat  
**Use Case**: Instruction following or chat-like applications  
**Promp Format**: [ChatML](/options/prompts#chatml)

https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B

Hermes 2 Pro is an upgraded, retrained version of Nous Hermes 2, consisting of
an updated and cleaned version of the OpenHermes 2.5 Dataset, as well as a newly
introduced Function Calling and JSON Mode dataset developed in-house.

This new version of Hermes maintains its excellent general task and conversation
capabilities - but also excels at Function Calling, JSON Structured Outputs,
and has improved on several other metrics as well, scoring a 90% on our function
calling evaluation built in partnership with Fireworks.AI, and an 84% on our
structured JSON Output evaluation.

Hermes Pro takes advantage of a special system prompt and multi-turn function
calling structure with a new chatml role in order to make function calling
reliable and easy to parse.

### Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B

A general use model that combines advanced analytics capabilities with a vast 13
billion parameter count, enabling it to perform in-depth data analysis and
support complex decision-making processes. This model is designed to process
large volumes of data, uncover hidden patterns, and provide actionable insights.

**Type**: Text Generation
**Use Case**: Generating output in response to arbitrary instructions
**Promp Format**: [Alpaca](/options/prompts#alpaca)

https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b

Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b is a state-of-the-art language model fine-tuned on over
300,000 instructions. This model was fine-tuned by Nous Research, with Teknium
and Emozilla leading the fine tuning process and dataset curation, Redmond AI
sponsoring the compute, and several other contributors.

This Hermes model uses the exact same dataset as Hermes on Llama-1. This is to
ensure consistency between the old Hermes and new, for anyone who wanted to keep
Hermes as similar to the old one, just more capable.

This model stands out for its long responses, lower hallucination rate, and
absence of OpenAI censorship mechanisms. The fine-tuning process was performed
with a 4096 sequence length on an 8x a100 80GB DGX machine.

### Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B

A general use model that offers advanced natural language understanding and
generation capabilities, empowering applications with high-performance
text-processing functionalities across diverse domains and languages. The model
excels in delivering accurate and contextually relevant responses, making it ideal
for a wide range of applications, including chatbots, language translation,
content creation, and more.

**Type**: Chat

reliable and easy to parse. Learn more about prompting below.

### Neural-Chat-7B

A revolutionary AI model for perfoming digital conversations.

**Type**: Chat
**Use Case**: Instruction following or chat-like applications
**Promp Format**: [Neural Chat](/options/prompts#neural-chat)

https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3

This model is a fine-tuned 7B parameter LLM on the Intel Gaudi 2 processor from
the Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1 on the meta-math/MetaMathQA dataset. The model was
aligned using the Direct Performance Optimization (DPO) method with
Intel/orca_dpo_pairs. The Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1 was originally fine-tuned
from mistralai/Mistral-7B-v-0.1. For more information, refer to the blog

### llama-3-sqlcoder-8b

A state of the art AI model for generating SQL queries from natural language.

**Type**: SQL Query Generation
**Use Case**: Generating SQL queries
**Promp Format**: [Llama-3-SQLCoder](/options/prompts#llama-3-sqlcoder)

https://huggingface.co/defog/llama-3-sqlcoder-8b

A capable language model for text to SQL generation for Postgres, Redshift and
Snowflake that is on-par with the most capable generalist frontier models.

### deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct

DeepSeek Coder is a capable coding model trained on two trillion code and natural
language tokens.

**Type**: Code Generation
**Use Case**: Generating computer code or answering tech questions
**Promp Format**: [Deepseek](/options/prompts#deepseek)

https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct

Deepseek Coder is composed of a series of code language models, each trained
from scratch on 2T tokens, with a composition of 87% code and 13% natural
language in both English and Chinese. We provide various sizes of the code model,
ranging from 1B to 33B versions. Each model is pre-trained on project-level code
corpus by employing a window size of 16K and a extra fill-in-the-blank task, to
support project-level code completion and infilling. For coding capabilities,
Deepseek Coder achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models
on multiple programming languages and various benchmarks.

### bridgetower-large-itm-mlm-itc

BridgeTower is a multimodal model for creating joint embeddings between images
and text.

_**Note: This Model is required to be used with the `/embeddings` endpoint. Most of the
SDKs will not ask you to provide model because it's using this one.**_

**Type**: Embedding Generation
**Use Case**: Used for generating text and image embedding

https://huggingface.co/BridgeTower/bridgetower-large-itm-mlm-itc

BridgeTower introduces multiple bridge layers that build a connection between
the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer of the cross-modal encoder.
This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal alignment and fusion between visual
and textual representations of different semantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal
encoders in the cross-modal encoder. Pre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream vision-language tasks.
In particular, on the VQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of
78.73%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with
the same pre-training data and almost negligible additional parameters and
computational costs. Notably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower
achieves an accuracy of 81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on
orders-of-magnitude larger datasets.

### llava-1.5-7b-hf

LLaVa is a multimodal model that supports vision and language models combined.

_**This Model is required to be used with the `/chat/completions` vision endpoint.
Most of the SDKs will not ask you to provide model because it's using this one.**_

**Type**: Vision Text Generation
**Use Case**: Used for generating text from text and image inputs

https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf

LLaVA is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LLaMA/Vicuna on
GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is an auto-regressive
language model, based on the transformer architecture.
